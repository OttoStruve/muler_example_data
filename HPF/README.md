# HPF Example Data


This directory includes example data from the Habitable Zone Planet Finder (HPF) spectrograph on the Hobby Eberly Telescope at McDonald Observatory in Fort Davis, Texas.


## 1. A0V telluric standards

The directory `01_A0V_standards` includes 3 distinct A0V Telluric Standards acquired in February, May, and August of 2021.  These spectra were reduced with Goldilocks.

## 2. Blank Dark Night Sky Emission

The directory `02_blank_sky` contains ten experimental calibration spectra of blank dark night sky acquired in parallel with unrelated LRS2-B observations.  These calibration data are intended to quantify the ratio of science-fiber--to--sky-fiber throughput differences for improved accuracy and precision of sky subtraction.  These spectra were reduced with Goldilocks.
